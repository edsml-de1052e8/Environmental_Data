# Lecture 12 : Physical principles of Earth Observation, orbits, sensors & resolution

- Main place to go for data format descriptors: GDAL

**Remote Sensing**
- aquisition of infor about an object without physical contact. 
- Usually taking images from spacecraft and aircraft and use images to extract infor about the Earth's surface
- Term first used after first Landsat in 1972
- Now 2000 EO satellites in space 
- Major aspects of EO: physical principles, aquisition, applications and processing

**Type of remote sensing**
- Passive remote sensing: naturally reflected rays are processed. Better during the day, at night only thermal part of the spectrum
- Active remote sensing: satellite actively generating the energy and recording eg. lidar, radar

**Workflow before 2000s**

- EO data collection -> level 0 raw data
- Search & order/pay for raw data -> level 0 binary
- Process and produce GIS ready images
- Interpret & analyse locally

**Today's workflow**
- All the processing going towards server side
- Don't need or have raw data locally 
- Geo coded multitemporal multisource data level1 geotiffs
- ATM: Airborne Thematic Mapper
- Planetary remote sensing: now resolution on Mars is similar to that on earth (can be up to cm)
Venus is v rocky, first optical image form Venera 9 in 1975
- Venus is very interesting because it is a 'hot' world that lost all its water, useful for our future

### Physical Principles 

**Electro-Magnetic Radiation (EMR)**

- EMR is an energy wave propagated through space between electric and magnetic fields c= v* lambda
- High frequency = short wave radiation
- Visible: 300-750 nm
- Visible IR: 0.4-0.9 micrometer
- NIR: 0.75-1.3 microns
- SWIR 1.3-

- Passive sensing: visible to SWIR, Thermal sensing in TIR
- Active sensing: long wavelengths eg. radio, microwaves, 


- EMR composed of many discrete units of matter called photons Q= h*v
- With Q as energy of photons, h as Planks cosnstant and v as frequency 
- So energy changes depending on the frequency used
- Higher frequency, shorter wavelength more damaging to humans
- Stefan-Boltzmann law: black body radiance emittance
- all matter at temperaturre greater than 0 Kelvin emits EMR
- How much energy an object emits is dependent on temperature
- sigma * T
- Wien's displacement law: the hotter it is the short the wavelength and higher the frequency
- lambdam = A/T
- Temp of Earth: around 300K, peak at 50 microns so TIR (outside visible range so can't see it)

**Interaction between EMR and atmosphere**

- Scattering: diffusion of radiation by particles in the atmosphere
- Rayleigh scattering: when particles are smaller in diameter than the wavelength, usually at short wavelength (effective on blue colour hence why sky is blue)
- Where there be no atmosphere such as on the Moon, the sky would be black
- Mie: when particle diameter essentially equals wavelength of EMR being sensed eg. water vapour
- Non-selective scattering: light is blocked or scattered in all directions, particles much larger than the wavelength
- So all these interfere with the amount of energy we have to measure

- SWIR bands can penetrate thin clouds and smoke, so get rid of them for better visibility
- Also problem of cloud shadows

- Absorption: effective loss of EMR energy to atmospheric constituents. Normally occurs at particular wavelengths
- Most efficient absorbers of solar radiation: water vapour, carbon dixoide and ozone

- Older generation sensors were designed to emit blue radiaition so not covering this wavelength
- That was to factor in the Rayleigh scattering
- Now sensors are more efficient at dealing with it 
- Terra Modis has large footprint and covers a lot of wavelengths up to TIR and mostly for global models

- EMR: either reflects, transmits or absorbs when it hits the ground 
- Can be diffuse reflectance (scattering by the surface), reflectance back and transmittance
- Reflectance depends on things such as surface roughness
- Two types of surfaces interacting with EMR: specular aka smooth and diffuse aka rough
- Surface will be smooth depending on Rayleigh criterion wich depends on surface irregularity height 
- Key parameters of spectral properties: spectral reflectance reflectivity of material at particular wavelength
- Albedo: intergral of reflected spectral radiation over spectral range
- Note that at night for passive sensors we can only see thermal part of spectrum (long wave radiation) but geothermal is also produced
- For satellites like Sentinel 2, need to separate daytime heating from nightime heating and compare as these satellites span 24 hours
- Emissivity and reflectance are inverse of each other
- In visible, ocean is black as it;s absorbing light and low reflectance, clouds are white due to high reflectance
- However with thermal sensor, this gives a reversed scaling -> clouds are white because they are cold and have low intensity and emission while land and ocean are darker due to high intensity and emission

**Orbits**

- Geostationary: altitude of 36,000km, synchronous with the rotation of the Earth. Used by most meteorological satellites eg. GOES, communication satellites . Produces images of low spatial res (1km) but allows continuous monitoring with frequent repeat (30-60mins)c

- Polar, Near-Polar, Sun-synchronous: altitude of 400-900km, covering most of the Earth at nearly same local time imaging (hence sun-synchronous) and revisit scene at fixed period ( eg. 18 days for Landsat 4&5)
- Ascending and descending passes: most EO satellites go down from pole during the day and ascend at night
- Because of the inclination angle (98 degrees) the orbit cannot cover the polar area. This is usually the case for nadir sensing satellites
- Revisit period = reimaging period

**Sensor Types**

- Large format and metric cameras, Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), return beam vidicon (RBV)
- Scanners: Thematic Mapper (TM), ETM+, High Resolution Visible (HRV), AVHRR, ASTER
- main imaging mechanisms: phototgraphy, pushbroom scanner
- along-track pushbroom scanner: nadir imaging  and off nadir imaging that peeps at the left and right thanks to adjustable fixed mirror, higher signal to noise ratio because it stays longer on ROI
- Hyperspectral scanner: have 10s to 100s of spectral bands, uses a hyperspectral disperse device that splits bands into multiple bands into 2D CCD array
- Most of these hypespectral scanner are airborne bc of poor signal to noise ratio (have to be closer to Earth)


### Resolution ###

**Spatial Resolution**

- smallest size between two objects that can be resolved by a sensor
- Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV): Height of sensor and angle will determine the resolution at surface

**Spectral Resolution*
- Describes the ability of a sensor to define fine intervals of wavelength
- Panchromatic (all visible): collects a lot of energy, high signal to noise ratio, 
- Multispectral image: combo of specific bands, high spectral resolution resolved by lower spatial resolution

- **Radiometric resolution**: ability to discriminate slight differences in sensor received energy levels (brightness) and usually characterised as a number of bits (per pixel) 
NB: 8 bits has 256 grey levels, in radiometric has 1 bit and so 2 levels of grey 

- **Temporal resolution**: charcterises the time it takes for the sensor to come back to its initial place, reimaging. But that's usually for nadir viewing satellite


- landsat orogram naming convention: starts with Landsat - Sensor-Satellite- year & Date- Archive version 

**EO commercial satellites**
- Planet Scope 93m and daily repeat, good for change analysis, ICL has an agreement with them
- SkySat 1 & 2 (HD)
- Earth i constellation
- X-band SAR eg. Capella Space, 3m 

**Data Format**
- Mostly Geotiff .tif
- can be Hierarchichal Data format .hdf
- Used to be flat binary raster .bil

Processing levels:
- Level 0 : raw system corrected data
- Level 1A: radiometrically corrected (TOA radiance)
- Level 1C: corrected to apparent reflectances
- Level 1G: geometrically corrected
- Level 1T: orthocorrected
- Level 2: generally corrected data, user end
